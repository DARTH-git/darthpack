# Validation  {#validation}

In this forth component, we check the internal validity of our Sick-Sicker model before we move on to the analysis components. To internally validate the Sick-Sicker model, we compare the model-predicted output evaluated at posterior parameters against the calibration targets. This is all done in the *04_validation.R* script in the `analysis` folder. 

In section _04.2 Compute model-predicted outputs_, we compute the model-predicted outputs for each sample of posterior distribution as well as for the MAP estimate. We then use the function `data_summary` to summarize the model-predicted posterior outputs into different summary statistics. 
```{r}
print.function(data_summary)
```
This function is informed by three arguments, `data`, `varname` and `groupnames`.

The computation of the model-predicted outputs using the MAP estimate is done by inserting the `v_calib_post_map` data into the previously described `calibration_out` function. This function creates a list including the estimated values for survival, prevalence and the proportion of sicker individuals at cycles 10, 20 and 30. 

In sections _04.6 Internal validation: Model-predicted outputs vs. targets_, we check the internal validation by plotting the model-predicted outputs against the calibration targets (Figures \@ref(fig:04-surv)-\@ref(fig:04-proportion)). The generated plots are saved as .png files in the *figs* folder. These files can be used in reports without the need of re-running the code.

```
