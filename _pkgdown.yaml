    In this component, all model input variables are declared and values are set.
    The point of this component is to group input variables together and organize 
    them in a logical fashion that can be easily communicated to a user.

    This component is the heart of the decision analysis: the implementation of 
    the decision model. In this section of the framework, a function is created 
    that maps model inputs to outputs, via the dynamic and/or stochastic 
    processes that the decision model represents. The model itself could be a 
    decision tree, Markov model, stochastic simulation, and so on. The output 
    stored from the model at this stage should be sufficiently general and 
    comprehensive to accommodate calibration, validation, and the main policy 
    analysis. Constructing the model as a function at this stage facilitates 
    subsequent components of model development and analysis, as these processes 
    will all call the same model function but pass different parameter values 
    and/or calculate different final outcomes from the model outputs. The model 
    function also facilitates the use of parallel computing efforts for 
    computationally intensive tasks, such as calibration and probabilistic 
    sensitivity analysis (PSA).
